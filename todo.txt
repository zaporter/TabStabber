Use message Get-State to see if tab is playing music, using the mic, or using the camera. DO NOT CLOSE in these cases. Might be worth adding to data

I have left a race condition sitting in the data updating part of the ontabdeath part of background.js. This wont matter until it does

The current indexing system has a process that grows by O(n) for background killin where n is the number of entries in storage.local. This can be made into O(log(n)) via a 2-layered system first keyed on id. It makes insertion slower though.... Worse performance for small n, far better for large n. Experimentation required. 
    
    Or as option 2: have a seperate system indexed by tab id that says which tabs it hasn't finished. This is very vulnerable to race conditions but could be written to be resilient. 


Look into whether or not values need to be stored as strings in storage.local.... I seem to remember a problem where if it was a complicated object then something failed. It is kind of a pain in the ass though


Fun idea: dont write to storage.local via the main.js script. Rather use background.js as an intermediary with an API. (Ouch... but probably a good idea in the long run)


Figure out about random forest generation.....
